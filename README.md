# xmmctl
A c rewrite of the python tool found in xmm7360-pci. Based on [Patrick Wildt's work](https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&m=162272049601997&w=2). It initialises a Fibocom L850-GL modem and sets up networking. Works on linux, should be easily portable to OpenBSD, since this is where most of the code comes from.
